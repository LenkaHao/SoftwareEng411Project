## Framework: NodeJS + Express

One of the reasons we decided to use Node.JS is its ease of use. Some of our group was already familiar with using it, and it proved simple enough to learn for the rest. 

Node.JS is known for being a top tool for multi-user and real time web applications which is perfect for what we are trying to accomplish. With its helpful built in tools and packages, along with the fact that it utilizes javascript which is becoming more popular, Node.JS seemed to be the perfect choice for us. 

Using Express was a given after we chose to use Node.JS as it helps cut down on a lot of work with its helpful packages. It also is the most popular framework for Node.JS.
